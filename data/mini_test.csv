Humans tend to look at insects through anthropological eyes , seeing them as friends or foes : they pollinate our crops , control pests , are important food in ecological food chains , help break down decaying matter , provide clues in criminal investigation and are useful models to study evolution , yet they eat and contaminate our food and homes , transmit devastating diseases and as a nuisance can prevent us from living in particular areas of the world .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ARG1 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PRD B-ARG2 I-ARG2 I-ARG2 I-ARG2 I-ARG2 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Strains of chicken that show only low levels of feather pecking activity appear to be less fearful than those that tend to be feather peckers , although this may be related to social motivation rather than fear ( Jones et al , 1995 ) . Although there are no strain differences in fearfulness , strains such as the White Leghorn tend to be more responsive than broiler strains when exposed to threat ( Keer - Keer et al , 1996 ) . Predation In their natural state , wild fowl will respond to overhead predation by remaining silent , crouching and freezing , whilst the response to ground predators is to call , run and fly away ( Appleby , Hughes and Elson , 1992 ) . The tendency to form groups is also as protection against predators .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	B-ARG1 I-ARG1 I-ARG1 I-ARG1 I-ARG1 I-ARG1 I-ARG1 I-ARG1 I-ARG1 I-ARG1 I-ARG1 I-ARG1 O O B-PRD B-ARG2 I-ARG2 I-ARG2 I-ARG2 I-ARG2 I-ARG2 I-ARG2 I-ARG2 I-ARG2 I-ARG2 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
